# AngularDynamicForm

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.3.
This project includes a dynamic form builder that automatically creates the form as a reactive form based on the information it receives from the server.
The project architecture includes several layers such as core-features-models-shared-config
The components related to the form builder are located in the shared layer
The core layer is information about services and http
The config layer stores information about constants such as the names of routes
The features layer maintains new pages and new features that will be added to the system

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
